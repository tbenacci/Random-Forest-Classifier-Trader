This is some code that prepares CRSP/Compustat data for weekly trading signals processed by a random forest classifier (unfortunately, the CRSP and Compustat data is too big for GitHub). Care is taken to avoid equity sample bias and missing weekdays due to holiday or emergency market closure are accounted for when calculating holding period returns (see data_prep.Rmd). I chose to run the actual machine learning in Python because of the ease of implementing the entropy criterion for tree splitting. Some draft analysis is conducted in the trading_analysis.Rmd file.
